# DDSM-Suite-Dynamic-Config-Script
This is a work in progress. The ultimate goal here is to
make a series of scripts that automate the DDSM and all
are fed their values from 1 global source. I have also
included a script manager that is a work in progress that
when finished will scan all scripts in that local 
directory and compile them into one script to be executed
instead of a bunch individually.
